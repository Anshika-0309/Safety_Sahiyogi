In an era marked by rapid urbanizaƟon and technological advancement, ensuring the safety 
and well-being of ciƟzens remains a paramount concern. To bridge the gap between 
authoriƟes and ciƟzens and for sƟmulaƟng effecƟve response mechanism, we propose a 
comprehensive web-based plaƞorm dedicated to accident prevenƟon, community safety, 
and emergency response. Our project, named "Safety-Sahiyogi” leverages the power of 
modern technology to empower communiƟes, enhance safety awareness, and facilitate 
Ɵmely response to criƟcal incidents.
The core features of Safety-Sahiyogi Connect include: 
- ReporƟng and Awareness spreading System: A user-friendly interface allowing ciƟzens to 
report various safety concerns such as traffic accidents, road hazards, workplace incidents, 
and environmental hazards and spread awareness about the same. 
- LocaƟon-based AuthenƟcaƟon: Ensuring that only residents of a specific locality can post 
about safety issues affecƟng their area, thereby enhancing the authenƟcity and relevance of 
reported incidents. 
- Real-Ɵme Alerts: Categorizing incidents as minor, moderate and criƟcal in order to 
prioritize responses, allocate resources effectively, and manage risks.
- Machine Learning PredicƟons: ImplementaƟon of machine learning algorithms to analyse 
historical data and predict the safety score of different localiƟes, enabling users to make 
informed decisions about their surroundings. 
- Community Engagement Features: Tools for community engagement, including discussion 
forums, polls, and volunteer networks, fostering collaboraƟon and collecƟve acƟon towards 
safety improvement. 
- Emergency Response IntegraƟon: CollaboraƟon with emergency response services to 
facilitate quick access to emergency contacts, report emergencies directly through the 
plaƞorm, and receive Ɵmely assistance.
-Efficient Response Management: Separate secƟon for resolved, parƟally resolved and 
unresolved requests to improve response management by the authority. 
In summary, Safety Sahiyogi represents a groundbreaking iniƟaƟve to harness the collecƟve 
power of technology, community engagement, and data-driven insights in pursuit of safer 
and more resilient communiƟes. By empowering ciƟzens, facilitaƟng collaboraƟon, and 
fostering innovaƟon, the plaƞorm aims to pave the way towards a safer, more secure future 
for all.
